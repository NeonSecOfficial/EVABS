[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v2/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://www.github.com/abhi-r3v0/EVABS)  [![GPL Licence](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/gpl/gpl.png?v=103)](https://www.github.com/abhi-r3v0/EVABS)

An open source Android application that is intentionally vulnerable so as to act as a learning platform for Android application security beginners. The effort is to introduce beginners with very limited or zero knowledge to some of the major and commonly found real-world based Android application vulnerabilities in a story-based, interactive model. EVABS follows a level-wise difficulty approach and in each level, the player learns a new concept. This project is still under progress and aims at incorporating as many levels as possible.

For complete details and solutions, head to the [wiki](https://github.com/abhi-r3v0/EVABS/wiki/Getting-Started-With-EVABS).
